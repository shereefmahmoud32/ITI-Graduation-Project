# ITI-Graduation-Project
https://github.com/IbrahimTarek555/ITI_GraduationProject
This project focuses on  the implementation of the Controller Area Network (CAN) Bus to facilitate the real-time presentation of vehicle data on a customized Graphical User Interface (GUI). The hardware components employed include AVR ATmega32, STM32f401CC, and Raspberry Pi 3B+, with MCP2515 as the CAN controller. The CAN Bus protocol is employed to ensure efficient and reliable data transfer among the embedded systems. They are ensuring precise vehicle data from the CAN Bus using an STM32F401CC microcontroller with an FPU-enabled FIR filter algorithm for accurate signal processing.

The Raspberry Pi 3B+ receives this data and displays it on a user-friendly GUI, providing a comprehensive overview of the vehicle's status and performance parameters. Moreover, the system is designed to relay this information to a remote server, enabling users to access real-time data from any location or time.

By leveraging the capabilities of MCP2515, AVR ATmega32, STM32f401CC, and Raspberry Pi 3B+, this project not only enhances the monitoring capabilities of vehicle data but also extends the accessibility of this information, thereby contributing to the development of more sophisticated and user-friendly vehicle telemetry systems.
